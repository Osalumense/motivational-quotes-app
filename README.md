## Description

This is a React JS application that generates random motivational quotes. <br/>
It was designed using TailwindCSS. <br/>
It demonstrates the useEffect and useState React Hooks which I intend to use more in future. <br/>
This application utilizes the random quotes API [more about that can be seen here](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)

### Live Demo

This application was hosted on vercel and can be viewed [here](https://motivational-quotes-app.vercel.app/)
